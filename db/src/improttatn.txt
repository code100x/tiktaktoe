# .app_data(actix_web::web::Data::new(db.clone()))

first you have to understand this 
HttpServer::new(move || {
    App::new()
        ...
})
Actix creates MULTIPLE OS WORKER THREADS, usually equal to CPU cores.

lets say we have 4 core machine Actix creastes 
Worker thread 1
Worker thread 2
Worker thread 3
Worker thread 4

Each worker thread runs:
App::new()
So the closure you provide is executed once for each worker.

# Now the important part  => 
.app_data(actix_web::web::Data::new(db.clone()))

What is happening here ? 

db.clone() is called
It clones the Arc inside PgPool
Now this worker thread has a pointer to the same real connection pool
Actix stores it in web::Data
Handlers can now access it:

why clone 
Because 

The closure is executed once per worker
Each worker needs its own copy of the pointer
But all pointers refer to the same underlying pool
You are not creating multiple pools.
